# Gesture-Mouse
This project demonstrates how to control a computer mouse cursor using head or hand gestures via an MPU6050 motion sensor and click using a flex sensor. The ESP32 reads the sensor data, processes it, and transmits movement and click events over Wi-Fi using UDP to a Python script running on the host computer. The Python script moves the system mouse accordingly.
