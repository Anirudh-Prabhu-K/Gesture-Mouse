# Gesture-Mouse
This project is a Wi-Fi-based gesture mouse developed using an ESP32 WROOM-32, MPU6050 gyroscope/accelerometer, and flex sensor. It captures real-time hand gestures and translates them into mouse cursor movements and click actions. The ESP32 acts as a web server, transmitting motion and gesture data wirelessly to a connected device.
